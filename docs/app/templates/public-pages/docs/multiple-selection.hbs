<h1 class="doc-page-title">Multiple dates</h1>

<p>
  The last use case is allowing the user to select several non-consecutive
  dates. Enter
  <code>power-calendar-multiple</code>.
</p>

<p>There is no much need of explanation, so lets see it in action. Play with it,
  click around and use the keyboard.</p>

<CodeExample @hbs="multiple-selection-1.hbs" @js="multiple-selection-1.js">
  {{component (ensure-safe-component this.multipleSelection1)}}
</CodeExample>

<p>
  When you want to select multiple dates, the
  <code>selected</code>
  property is, unsurprisingly, an array of dates.
</p>

<p>
  Every time you select a day, the
  <code>onSelect</code>
  action is called not with the date, but with an object. That object has a
  <code>date</code>
  property, containing the selected value as a native Javascript date, and if
  you have decided to use
  <strong>Moment.js</strong>, a
  <code>moment</code>
  property containing the same dates as a moment object, or a
  <code>datetime</code>
  property containing the array Luxon.DateTime if you are using Luxon.
</p>

<p>
  It's worth noticing that clicking on a selected day unselects it and that the
  days are passed in the order they are clicked.
</p>

<p>
  Since what the
  <code>onSelect</code>
  action does is up to you, you can implement any logic you want, no matter how
  <del>absurd</del>
  complex it is.
</p>

<p>
  By example, let's implement a calendar that allows you to click on any day,
  and when you do, it selects the nearest day which number is prime, selecting
  the lowest one in case of a tie.
</p>

<CodeExample @hbs="multiple-selection-2.hbs" @js="multiple-selection-2.js">
  {{component (ensure-safe-component this.multipleSelection2)}}
</CodeExample>

<p>
  Why would anyone want to do that?! No clue.
</p>

<p>
  Another thing to note is that selection order is preserved. The last clicked
  element is at the last position of the array, so you can use this kind of
  calendar to perform order sensitive selections:
</p>

<CodeExample @hbs="multiple-selection-3.hbs">
  {{component (ensure-safe-component this.multipleSelection3)}}
</CodeExample>

<p>
  You can also set a
  <code>maxLength</code>
  property on the days component for the maximum number of days that can be
  selected
</p>

<CodeExample @hbs="multiple-selection-4.hbs">
  {{component (ensure-safe-component this.multipleSelection4)}}
</CodeExample>

<p>
  Now lest talk about serious business. Customization.
