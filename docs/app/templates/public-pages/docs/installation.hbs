<h1 class="doc-page-title">Installation &amp; setup</h1>

<p>
  Ember-power-calendar is distributed as an <a href="http://www.ember-cli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ember-cli</a> addon,
  so the major part of installation will be done by following command on your ember project
</p>

<div class="highlight">
  <pre class="language-command"><code class="language-command">$ ember install ember-power-calendar</code></pre>
</div>

<p>But this is not enough to put the calendar to work.</p>

<h3>Choose your preferred date library</h3>

<p>
  Date manipulation is <em>hard</em>. Date internationalization is even harder. That's why this
  component needs help from a third party date library to display and manipulate dates.
</p>

<p>
  From the ones available out there <a href="http://momentjs.com">Moment.js</a> and <a href="">Luxon</a>
  are my favorites, and I created two addons you can choose from to make Ember Power Calendar work
  that use those libraries:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/cibernox/ember-power-calendar-luxon">Ember Power Calendar Luxon</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/cibernox/ember-power-calendar-moment">Ember Power Calendar Moment</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/makepanic/ember-power-calendar-date-fns">Ember Power Calendar date-fns</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> Although the calendars should behave the same regardless of the option you choose,
  there might be subtle differences in how dates are displayed, as Moment.js bundles its own translations
  while Luxon uses the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DateTimeFormat">Intl.DateTimeFormat</a> native API
  to localize dates into the user's language (that also means Luxon is a lighter library).
</p>

<p>
  Choose the one you prefer and just install it as any other addon, for instance <code>ember install ember-power-calendar-luxon</code>,
  and your calendar will work, but will look ugly.
</p>

<p>
  After you have installed you need to register the date library to <code>ember-power-calendar</code>. For <code>ember-power-calendar-moment</code> you need to add this lines.
  <CodeSnippet @name="installation.js" class="active" />
  
  If you are using any other date library please check the ReadMe of the package.
</p>

<h3>Add the styles</h3>

<p>
  If you use vanilla CSS, you need to add the following line into <code>app.js</code> or in any route/controller/component <code>.js/.ts</code> file:
</p>

<CodeBlock @language="js" @code="import 'ember-power-calendar/styles';" />

<p>
  Instead of adding the styling in an <code>.js</code> file and depending from your build config you can also add the css in any template/component css file by using following line
</p>

{{!-- template-lint-disable no-potential-path-strings --}}
<CodeBlock @language="css" @code="@import 'ember-power-calendar/vendor/ember-power-calendar.css';" />

<p>
  However, if you are using SASS or LESS you need to add an import statement to your styles.
</p>

<CodeSnippet @name="installation-1.scss" class="active" />

<p>
  Doing that will bring in all of the styles except those related to the size of the calendar.
  For defining the size of the calendar there is a mixin that takes the size of the cell
  you want your calendar to be. By example:
</p>

<CodeSnippet @name="installation-2.scss" class="active" />
<br>

<p>
  The <code>ember-power-calendar</code> mixin also allows a great amount of customization regarding the coloring of the
  calendar.
</p>
<CodeSnippet @name="installation-2a.scss" class="active" />
<br>

<p>
  For those using Less, the process is very similar. Import the addon styles with:
</p>
<CodeSnippet @name="installation-3.less" class="active" />
<br>

<p>
  The mixin provided can be used like so:
</p>
<CodeSnippet @name="installation-4.less" class="active" />
<br>

<p>
  This code above will make each one of those classes have a different size.
</p>

<h3>Install ember-concurrency (required peerDependency)</h3>

<p>
  The addon is using internal ember-concurrency. For installation see <a href="http://ember-concurrency.com/docs/installation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ember-concurrency</a> installation page.
