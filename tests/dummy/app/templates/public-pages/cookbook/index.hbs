<h1 class="doc-page-title">System-wide config</h1>

<p>
  There is a fair amount of option on this component that allow to configure how it looks and how it behaves,
  if you want all the calendars of your app to always behave the same, it can be tiring to pass the same options
  over and over.
</p>

<p>
  Is there a way of changing the defaults of the component(s) in a way that you don't have to pass the same options everywhere?
</p>

<p>
  Yes, and it's simpler than you think.
</p>

<p>
  Inside your app's <code>/app/components/</code> folder create a <code>power-calendar.js</code>
  file that exports a component inherits from the one provided by the addon, and define on it the
  values you want them to be the new defaults.
</p>

<p>
  By example, if you develop a nicer <code><calendar.Nav/></code> component that you want to user
  in every calendars, you could do this:
</p>

{{code-snippet name="system-wide-config-1-js.js"}}

<p>
  That's all. No new concepts to learn, just your usual ember-cli work flow.
</p>

<p>
  In this example the component is also named <code>\{{power-calendar}}</code> but if you want the default
  component to still be available, just define it in a file with a different name.
