<h1 class="doc-page-title">Range selection</h1>

<p>
  The most common use case of calendars is selecting a single day. The second most common one is selecting a
  duration, aka, a range.
</p>

<p>
  The only differences in the API between a calendar for selecting a single day and a calendar
  for selecting a range are that the name of the component is now <code>power-calendar-range</code> and that
  the <code>selected</code> option has to implement the <code>Range</code> interface.
  It might sound scary, but it only means that it has to be an object with <code>start</code> and <code>end</code>
  properties.
</p>

<p>
  The same <code>onSelect</code> action used in the previous chapter to select one date,
  is now used to select a range. The object that this action receives has a <code>date</code> and
  either <code>moment</code> or <code>datetime</code> properties, each one containing a range with the
  dates in native Date objects or in momentJS/Luxon.DateTime objects.
</p>

<p>
  Lets see this in action.
</p>

<CodeExample @hbs="range-selection-1.hbs" @js="range-selection-1.js">
  {{component (ensure-safe-component this.rangeSelection1)}}
</CodeExample>

<p>
  All the days in the range are selected, and the ends of the range have some special
  classes so you can style them differently.
</p>

<p>
  Let's see an example:
</p>

<CodeExample @hbs="range-selection-2.hbs" @js="range-selection-2.js">
  {{component (ensure-safe-component this.rangeSelection2)}}
</CodeExample>

<p>Hey, I never said I was a brilliant designer! But you get the idea.</p>

<h3>The <code>minRange</code> and <code>maxRange</code> option</h3>

<p>
  Usually the only restriction in ranges is that they have to start in one day and end in a different day,
  but sometimes you want to be more restrictive on the length of the range, so the <code>minRange</code> and
  <code>maxRange</code> cover this they way you expect them to.
</p>

<p>
  Those options accept a <code>number</code> and a <code>string</code>. If you are using Moment, it can also
  take a <code>moment.Duration</code> object, and if you are using Luxon a <code>Luxon.Duration</code> one.
  The default minimum range is one day, so the range has to start in a different date from where it begins and
  there is no maximum range.
</p>

<p>If you want to force the user to pick a range of at least 3 days you can just pass a number:</p>

<CodeExample @hbs="range-selection-3.hbs">
  {{component (ensure-safe-component this.rangeSelection3)}}
</CodeExample>

<p>
  Notice that once you select one end of the range the days that cannot be selected are disabled automatically.
</p>

<p>
  This property accepts humanized durations which makes it very nice to use with different units other than days.
  Let's make the range be of at most one week.
</p>

<CodeExample @hbs="range-selection-4.hbs">
  {{component (ensure-safe-component this.rangeSelection4)}}
</CodeExample>

<p>
  As you'd expect, you can also use the abbreviations accepted by <code>MomentJs</code> and
  combine <code>minRange</code> and <code>maxRange</code> as you want.
</p>

<CodeExample @hbs="range-selection-5.hbs">
  {{component (ensure-safe-component this.rangeSelection5)}}
</CodeExample>

<p>
  If you want to allow ranges to begin and end on the same day, pass <code>minRange=0</code>.
</p>

<CodeExample @hbs="range-selection-6.hbs">
  {{component (ensure-safe-component this.rangeSelection6)}}
</CodeExample>

<h3>The <code>proximitySelection</code> option</h3>
<p>
  This option changes the behaviour of date selection after a choosing a start and an end date. The default behaviour
  on the third click will select a new start date of a brand new range. With this flag enabled, once you have a range,
  clicking a third time will move the closest of the extremes, narrowing or extending the range.
</p>

<CodeExample @hbs="range-selection-7.hbs">
  {{component (ensure-safe-component this.rangeSelection7)}}
</CodeExample>

<p>
  Now let's see how to select several non-consecutive dates.
