<p>
  Ember Power Calendar aims to allow users to create the ideal calendar they need
  using only the properties and actions defined in its public API, so it is important
  to have a comprehensive list of all the available options.

<h3>The <code>day</code> object</h3>

  The day object is an object received by many actions, blocks and components and one of the
  interfaces you will use more often.
